This project was created in my spare time and is not backed by professional support. I appreciate any contributions and suggestions, though I ask for your patience as my response times may vary. Together, let's fuel our coding enthusiasm! 🚀

**Compatibility:** Currently, only for Ubuntu.

Used only in ubuntu
